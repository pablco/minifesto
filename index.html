    <div class="blog_post_content">
        <p>Pareto's law states that <em>80% of the results come from 20% of features</em> (effort) of your
            application. Bear this in mind when planning the next scrum/delivery.</p>

        <p>The best engineers are those who can <em>estimate the effort</em> of new requirements and they are the
            only with enough information to refuse the 80% that is not in the optimal next scope.</p>

        <p><em>Own it</em>! This is not the army, they pay you to think and take decisions and responsibility so
            <em>speak up</em> if you consider the requirements proposed are superfluous.</p>

        <p>The <em>worst</em> code you've ever written is the code that is no longer used. It's called YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It).</p>

        <p>The <em>best</em> code you've ever written is the code you didn't write, simply because it's the only
            that never fails.</p>

            or by <em>erosion</em> (client changed his mind). These are good examples where prioritization and
            waiting saved you from doing a worthless job.</p>

    <div class="blog_post_content">
        <p>Look for perfection, but not yet. <em>Iteration</em> is that friend that gives you the right advises at
            the right time.</p>

        <p><em>First do it</em>, then do it right, then do it better.</p>

        <p>Engineers like to think that the world could be designed, however Nature shows the opposite. Any
            sufficiently complex system cannot be built out of design, <em>it has to be evolved</em>.</p>

        <p>Consider everything as a work in progress and don't panic if it doesn't work right yet, remember <em>Mosher's
            law</em>, if everything worked right, you'd be out of a job.</p>

    <div class="blog_post_content">
        <p>Nobody can know much of everything.</p>

        <p>Try to <em>ask yourself</em> how can you add value to your team. What do they need the most? Somebody who
            is an expert with scalability?, Somebody who knows every detail of the programming language? Somebody
            more focused in the product? A coordinator?</p>

        <p>Every team is different so you have to <em>adapt</em> and choose, try to analyse the strengths and
            weakness of both you and your team.</p>

        <p>Learn to love a particular thing and <em>master it</em>. Try to position yourself, it's like a brand, you
            like products that fulfill your needs not those who do a lot of things you already do by yourself.</p>

        <p>Of course it's easier to get along well with people with whom you share common language but the real
            power is on <em>complementary people</em>, remember the A-team!</p>

    <div class="blog_post_content">
        <p>In some late point of our life we realise about the importance of basics. It's normally old people who
            claim they have gone <em>back to basics</em>. Don't be a fool and don't wait to realise about that so
            late, bet for basics, first.</p>

        <p>There are very valuable concepts in CS (Computer Science) and the good thing is that you can apply them
            to <em>every</em> new design. You should try always a top-down thinking starting from them.</p>

        <p>Borrowing an old saying, the three most important things in software development are:
            <em>architecture</em>, architecture and architecture, in that order.</p>

        <p>Some examples of basics are:

    <h2 class="blog_post_title"><a href="/">Think different</a></h2>

    <div class="blog_post_content">
        <p><em>Simple</em> is harder than complex, minimalism requires a lot of creativity in order to find new ways
            of doing more with less.</p>

        <p>Technical Skill is the mastery of complexity, while <em>Creativity</em> is the master of simplicity.</p>

        <p>Creativity is intelligence having fun! so enjoy the opportunity.</p>

        <p>So don't focus on working more, but in working less but smartly, Think! about your work, turn off the
            autopilot, leave the <em>comfort zone</em> and take control.</p>

        <p>And hey! Don't be shy, it takes guts to change the status quo. But remember, the world you are living in
            is made by people no smarter than you are, they just <em>believed</em> it was possible.</p>

        <p>Of course people will think you are a weirdo sometimes because the things you try are different, but you
            can't be a <em>leader</em> if you are not an innovator.</p>

        <p>For example I'm sure every one of us has thought in some point that his company is losing too much time
            in meetings where you discuss about nothing. So Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon, has a particular
            and apparently a <a target="_blank"

            way to conduct meetings in his company. When all the attendants arrive to the meeting room they have 30
            minutes to read the report of the meeting IN STRICT SILENCE. After that the meeting can start.</p>

        <p>We have to write <em>code for humans</em>, not machines, and synthesis is the key of communication.</p>

        <p>A good example is the Pascal's quotation "If I Had More Time, I Would Have Written a <em>Shorter</em>
            Letter".</p>

        <p>Try to keep methods as short as possible, classes with a single responsibility, few parameters, avoid

    <h2 class="blog_post_title"><a href="/">Keep it plain</a></h2>

    <div class="blog_post_content">
        <p>In software programming you can solve any problem by adding another layer of indirection, except the
            problem of <em>too much indirection</em>. This is true, and it means that we have to find balance in the
            complexity of our designs.</p>

        <p>Abstraction is good, it allows us to create a <em>new semantic level</em> in which one can be absolutely
            precise. However, in some cases like refactoring we have to understand the big picture and it makes
            everything harder.</p>

        <p>This is why we have to look for the natural points where we can make the division and try to understand
            the different possible <em>trade-offs</em>.</p>

        <p>Examples of that are: Root-Leaf paradigm in Domain Model. Controller/Tools paradigm, <a target="_blank"

    <div class="blog_post_content">
        <p>There's a concept named <em>kipple</em> that refers to all those things we keep but we never use. Our
            homes are full of it, so are our codebases. For example, legacy methods we are afraid to delete,
            just-in-case libraries we will never need, out of date comments…</p>

        <p>It's only human nature to complicate so we have to enforce ourselves to <em>simplify</em>. This is a
            process we have to follow periodically, identify the kipple and destroy it.</p>

        <p>Minimalism: it's all about <em>avoiding distractions</em> so that we can focus in the important things.
